front end app for my tram app project. connects to my server running on an aws instance (http://tram.mintyasleep.net:3000/) rather than the metrolink api directly to reduce load on the app and the api but likely still scales really badly. it's cute though

as of 2026: i moved everything to a newer version of react native, etc. and added notices that show up on the app. i would like to add clicking on each individual station to show boards in the future.
